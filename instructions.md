## Assignment Instructions

*This assessment task is worth **20%** of the course's mark.* (Unless adjusted by mutual agreement).

In this assessment task, we are going to emulate the way a programming team works
on a single project using Github or Bitbucket to manage their work.

We are asking you to work individually on one section of the task and then combine
your work to produce a group respository and a group report.

We will assess your collaboration skills in reviewing, making pull requests and so on.

## The individual task

We are providing you with a notebook that imports several functions that are used in 
constructing a map (with the `cartopy` package). You don't need to change this notebook
and, in fact, other than a few cosmetic changes, we really would like you to leave it alone.

Your job is to provide all the functions that are needed to make the notebook run. We are happy to
show you an example of how we did this but it will be up to you to write your own versions.

All of those functions will need **docstrings** and **tests** even if they are relatively 
simple because that is how you would have to work on a collaborative scientific project or
a project that you write for yourself over any length of time.

## The group task

In groups of three or four, you will be given access to a group repository. Each group member
will have to write their individual solution to the notebook problem in a subdirectory `UserX`. 

We expect you to manage this task through GitHub pull requests. We would like to see each of
you make one or more pull requests, review somebody else's pull request, raise issue(s) and 
check that they can be closed, etc.

You also need to collaboratively create a `README.md` file for the group repository that will
describe the repository's contents and anybody to click through to find your individual notebooks.
The `README.md` file is the one that GitHub highlights when you view a repository and it should be
aimed at us as new users of your maps so we can see what you did without having to ask you.

We would further like you to document how you all collaborated with a short markdown report 
that, again, is developed collaboratively. Each of you should contribute to it via pull requests, etc.
Please use this report as an opportunity to highlight the aspects of the marking rubric that we
are going to be evaluating for the group.

## The nuts and bolts

We will lead you through the process of copying the repository (a fork), show you how
to clone the repository to our group server, and how to edit the code. We understand
that working around git cloning/forkign/pushing/pulling might be daunting the first
time so we will be around to support any of these (technical) aspects of the assessment.

## Marking Rubric

We will develop this marking rubric with you in class so that you
understand what this exercise is about.


## Marking Scheme

We split the assessment into a series of tasks and mark each one
as great (A/100), good (B/80), ok (C/60), horrible or not attempted (F/0). 
Some tasks will be yes/no: Y (100) / N (0) 


| Task | Assessed | Mark percentage %|
|:-------------- |:-----------:|:-----:|
| Does the notebook run                     | Yes/No | X % |
| Was at least one review well constructed  | A, B, C, F | X1 % |
| Meaningful tests ?                        | A, B, C, F | X1 % |
